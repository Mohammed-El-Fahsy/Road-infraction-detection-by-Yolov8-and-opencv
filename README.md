# Road-infraction-detection-by-Yolov8-and-opencv
This project consists of a real-time road infractions detection system based on computer vision and deep learning. YOLOv8 is used for vehicle detection, while OpenCV is applied for image processing and road line analysis. The system detects traffic violations  by analyzing the position of vehicles relative to road markings.
